## 🚧 Current Major Project: NixOS Migration (2025)

I'm planning and executing a **complete infrastructure migration** from ZimaOS (Debian) to NixOS for my entire 40+-service production environment.

**Why NixOS?**
- 🔧 Declarative system configuration (Infrastructure as Code at OS level)
- ♻️ Atomic rollbacks and reproducible builds  
- 📦 Separation of system state and configuration
- 🔄 Simplified disaster recovery through "system as code"

**Migration Strategy:**
- Zero-downtime target for critical services
- Service-by-service migration with rollback capability
- Data migration for 33TB BTRFS RAID5 storage
- Comprehensive documentation of entire process

**Current Phase:** Planning & Testing | **Target:** Q2-Q3 2025

**What This Demonstrates:**
- Production change management and risk assessment
- Modern Infrastructure-as-Code practices beyond containers
- Complex project planning and execution
- Technical decision-making for system architecture
